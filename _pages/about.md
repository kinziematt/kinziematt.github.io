I am a lawyer turned data scientist who combines communication ability, business sense, project management, and technical skills.

Because of my experience as a lawyer, I am well placed to work in the nascent field of *legal analytics*. Thinking like a lawyer also helps me during data science projects because I see and resolve ambiguities and think ahead to what can go wrong.
